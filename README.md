<h3>Origins</h3>

In anticipation of applying for my first co-op position in the summer of 2021, I was looking at résumé makers online; however, none of them caught my eye. This led me to start working on Résumaker, aiming to strike a balance between ease-of-use and professional elegance. My own résumé, as well as those of many of my friends, are made with the Résumaker and have been leveraged to successfully land co-op placements and internships.
